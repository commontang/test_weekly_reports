week1
_____
1.During the week, I gradually coordinated the relationship between the learning tasks and the school curriculum:In the class (both important and unimportant) to complete the  preparation, review,and consolidation of important lessonsï¼Œ generally only homework needs to be completed outside the classroom.I can do the study tasks at other times,which will become my time to improve myself and complete tasks in the future.Next, I will put this learning mode into practice more.

2.I roughly completed other tasks besides github operation learning this week.

3.I have configured the relevant programs and environments, but I am lacking in programming practice.

4.I don't have a deep understanding of the completion process of C programming and don't know a lot of extended knowledge. 

5.Complete corresponding and legacy tasks and expand the depth of learning as much as possible.
