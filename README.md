Weekly reports
================

week1
_____
1.During the week, I gradually coordinated the relationship between the learning tasks and the school curriculum:In the class (both important 
  and unimportant) to complete the  preparation, review,and consolidation of important lessons， generally only homework needs to be completed 
  outside the classroom.I can do the study tasks at other times,which will become my time to improve myself and complete tasks in the future.
  Next, I will put this learning mode into practice more.

2.I roughly completed other tasks besides github operation learning this week.

3.I have configured the relevant programs and environments, but I am lacking in programming practice.

4.I don't have a deep understanding of the completion process of C programming and don't know a lot of extended knowledge. 

5.Complete corresponding and legacy tasks and expand the depth of learning as much as possible.   

week2
______
1.The study time this week is normal.

2.I am on the learning task for computer networks and working on the creation of the echo server.

3.Maybe I won't have enuogh time to Complete the learning tasks of 5G communication.

4.I do not know the IP of the server of the team mentioned in the  learning task,is it canceled？

5.Do my best to complete the eco server and try to complete as many learning tasks as possible.

week3 
______
1.I felt pressed for time.

2.I've written my echo server with references,having a preliminary understanding of network programming

3.The code for the echo server will be uploaded soon.(I did not specify the IP and port of the server in the header file)

4.It's a pity I don't have time to learn about 5G communication.

5.I will take the assessment seriously.

In the course of this study, I have some feelings.
6.Knowing what you want to learn, how to learn, and where to learn is more important than 
  the process of learning itself.This feeling is especially strong when I start learning something else after learning the basics of the C 
  language.linux,gcc,gnu make,git hub…I spend no less time in knowing what they are and where they can be learned, looking for learning 
  materials than learning them themselves.  
7.Practice is important.In my study of echo server-related code, I developed a preliminary understanding of network programming.The learning
  process of reviewing materials, learning functions and structures, commenting on code, and correcting mistakes is full of fulfillment
